gptme documentation
===================

Welcome to the documentation for ``gptme``!

``gptme`` is a personal AI assistant and agent platform that runs in your terminal and browser, equipped with powerful tools to execute code, edit files, browse the web, and more - acting as an intelligent copilot for your computer. The core components include:

- **gptme CLI**: The main :doc:`command-line interface <cli>` for terminal-based interactions
- **gptme-server**: A :doc:`server component <server>` for running gptme as a service
- **gptme-webui**: A :doc:`web interface <server>` for browser-based interactions
- **gptme-agent-template**: A template for creating custom :doc:`AI agents <agents>`

The system can execute python and bash, edit local files, search and browse the web, and much more through its rich set of :doc:`built-in tools <tools>` and extensible :doc:`tool system <custom_tool>`. You can see what's possible in the :doc:`examples` and :doc:`demos`, from creating web apps and games to analyzing data and automating workflows.

**Getting Started:** To begin using gptme, follow the :doc:`getting-started` guide, set up your preferred :doc:`LLM provider <providers>`, and customize your :doc:`configuration <config>` as needed.

The system is designed to be easy to use and extend, and can be used as a library, standalone application, or web service. For detailed usage patterns and features, see the :doc:`usage` guide.

See the `README <https://github.com/gptme/gptme/blob/master/README.md>`_ file for more general information about the project.
