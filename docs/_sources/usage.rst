Usage
=====

This guide covers common usage patterns and examples for gptme.

To start a new chat or select an existing one, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme

This will show you a list of past chats, allowing you to select one or start a new one.

To get inspiration for your first prompt, see the :doc:`examples`.

Interfaces
----------

Besides the CLI, gptme can be used through:

- :ref:`server:gptme-webui` - A web-based interface
- A `desktop app <https://github.com/gptme/gptme-tauri>`_ (WIP)
- :doc:`bot` - GitHub bot integration

Features
--------

Here is a very quick overview of the main features of gptme.

.. rubric:: Tools

gptme comes with a variety of tools for different tasks:

- :ref:`tools:shell` - Execute shell commands
- :ref:`tools:python` - Run Python code
- :ref:`tools:browser` - Browse and interact with web content
- :ref:`tools:vision` - Process and analyze images

See the :doc:`tools` page for a complete list of available tools.

Writing Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can ask the assistant to create new files or modify existing ones:

.. chat::

   User: implement game of life in life.py

   Assistant: Certainly! I'll create a new file named `life.py` implementing Conway's Game of Life. This implementation will use NumPy for efficient array operations and Matplotlib for visualization. Here's the code:
   ```save life.py
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
   ...
   ```

   System: Saved to life.py

Making Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can start chats and request changes directly from the command line. The contents of any mentioned text files will be included as context, and the assistant will generate patches to apply the requested changes:

.. code-block:: bash

   gptme 'make improvements to life.py so dead cells fade out over time'

.. chat::

   User: make improvements to life.py so dead cells fade out over time
   ```life.py
   ...
   ```

   Assistant: To make alive cells green and dead cells black in the Game of Life simulation, we need to modify the colormap and how we represent the cell states. Here's the updated `life.py` script with these changes:
   ```patch life.py
   ...
   ```

   System: Patch applied

Browser Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the :ref:`tools:browser` extras installed, the assistant can read URLs (included in the prompt or with its ``read_url`` tool) and "see" web pages by taking screenshots and viewing them.

Multiprompt syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``-`` separator allows you to chain multiple prompts together, letting the assistant finish running tools for one prompt before moving on to the next:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme 'create a project' - 'add tests' - 'commit changes'

This is particularly useful for breaking down complex tasks into steps and creating :doc:`automation` workflows.

Queue follow-up prompts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If another ``gptme`` process is already busy in a conversation, queue the next
user turn from a second terminal instead of waiting for the current step to
finish:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme-util chats send chat-123 "once the tests finish, summarize the failures"

The running conversation will drain the queued prompt on its next turn. Use
``gptme-util chats list`` if you need to look up the conversation ID first.

Tool Selection Patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use ``--tools`` to control which tools are available.

- ``--tools read,append`` replaces defaults with exactly those tools.
- ``--tools +computer`` adds the ``computer`` tool on top of defaults.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Add computer use while keeping the standard default tools
    gptme --tools +computer "take a screenshot and summarize what you see"

For long visual tasks, use a subagent profile to avoid bloating parent context
with repeated screenshots:

.. code-block:: python

    # Desktop interaction (mouse, keyboard, screenshots)
    subagent(
        "computer-use",
        "Click the Submit button, wait for the modal, and screenshot the result",
    )

    # Web browsing and testing
    subagent(
        "browser-use",
        "Navigate web app UI, capture evidence, and return a concise bug report",
    )

See available profiles with:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme-util profile list

Minimal context mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you want a tighter startup prompt for a specialized task, combine a short
system prompt, a narrow tool set, and selective context:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme --system short --tools shell,read,patch,save --context files "fix the failing test"

Use ``--no-workspace`` to skip all project-specific context (prompt files and
``context_cmd`` output) in one flag — tools and the core prompt are still
included:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme --no-workspace --system short --tools shell,read,patch,save "apply this patch"

Measure the prompt before and after with:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme --show-prompt-stats

That prints per-section token counts for the startup system prompt so you can
see whether the cost is coming from tool docs, user profile text, workspace
prompt files, or dynamic ``context_cmd`` output.

For a deeper recipe, see :doc:`howto/minimal-context`.

Skip confirmation prompts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can skip confirmation prompts using the ``--no-confirm`` flag. This is useful when you are confident the LLM will do what you want, so you don't want to have to confirm actions:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme --no-confirm 'create a snake game using curses in snake.py, dont run it'

Non-interactive mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``--non-interactive`` flag runs gptme in a mode that terminates after completing all prompts. This is useful for scripting and automation:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme --non-interactive 'create a snake game using curses in snake.py, dont run it' '-' 'make the snake green and the apple red'

Note: ``--non-interactive`` implies ``--no-confirm``, so you don't need to specify both.

Machine-readable output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pair ``--non-interactive`` with ``--output-format json`` when stdout needs to
be consumed by another program. In JSON mode, gptme emits one JSON object per
line on stdout (JSONL):

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme --non-interactive --output-format json 'summarize this repository'

Use ``--resume`` to continue an existing automated conversation without
supplying a new prompt. This also picks up any queued follow-up prompts for the
current conversation before exiting:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme --non-interactive --output-format json --resume

.. _pre-commit:

Pre-commit Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

gptme integrates with `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__ to catch code quality issues early. When enabled, it will automatically run pre-commit checks after file modifications, right before yielding control back to the user, to let the assistant address issues without human intervention.

- Enabled automatically if a ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` exists in any parent directory
- Can be explicitly enabled/disabled with ``GPTME_CHECK=true/false``
- Runs after file modifications to catch issues early
- Shows output in conversation when issues are found
- Distinguishes between automatically fixed issues and those requiring manual fixes

Example workflow:

.. chat::

   User: create a new file named main.py with a simple function

   Assistant: Sure! I'll create a new file named `main.py` with a simple function that adds two numbers together. Here's the code:
   ```save main.py
   def my_function(x, y):
       return x + y
   ```

   System: Saved to main.py

   Assistant: I have created the file.

   System: Pre-commit checks failed
   ```stdout
   typecheck................................................................Failed
   - hook id: typecheck
   - exit code: 1
   main.py: error: Function is missing type hints
   ```

   Assistant: Typechecks failed, I'll update the function to use type hints.
   ```patch main.py
   <<<<<<< ORIGINAL
   def my_function(x, y):
   =======
   def my_function(x: int, y: int) -> int:
   >>>>>>> UPDATED
   ```

   System: Patch applied

   Assistant: Great, the typecheck should now pass.
